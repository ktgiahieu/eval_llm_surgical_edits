## Abstract

The growing volume of scientific paper submissions raises interest in LLMs as review assistants, but imitation of historical reviews risks reproducing spurious correlations and biases. We propose a controlled-intervention protocol to test whether an agent is causally sensitive to real quality improvements. Each instance uses a triplet of papers (original flawed, substantive human revision, and superficial LLM revision) to assess whether the agent detects genuine improvements while ignoring superficial edits. The strongest models successfully detect gains in flaw categories requiring internal logical consistency, while exhibiting near-zero or negative sensitivity to those requiring external empirical verification.

This repository contains the code and results for the paper "Evaluating LLM Judgment via Surgical Edits". The project implements a comprehensive evaluation framework that includes error planting, placebo generation, and revision verification across multiple models and ablation scenarios.

## Overview

The evaluation framework consists of three main components:

1. **Error Planting**: Systematically introducing methodological flaws into research papers based on reviewer-identified issues
2. **Placebo Generation**: Creating "sham surgery" versions that maintain writing style but don't introduce flaws
3. **Verification**: Testing whether LLMs can distinguish between:
   - Real revisions (camera-ready papers that genuinely address flaws)
   - LLM-generated fixes (superficial changes without substantive improvements)

The framework uses a controlled intervention protocol with triplets of papers (original flawed, substantive human revision, and superficial LLM revision) to assess whether LLMs detect genuine improvements while ignoring superficial edits.
