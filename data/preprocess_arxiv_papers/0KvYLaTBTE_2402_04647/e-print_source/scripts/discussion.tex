We omit the Antmaze-large experiment from the main text and included potential reasons for LPT's unsatisfactory performance in~\cref{appen:antmaze}. Another interesting direction is to study LPT's continual learning potential. During planning, LPT explores with provably efficient posterior sampling~\citep{osband2013more, osband2017posterior}.
