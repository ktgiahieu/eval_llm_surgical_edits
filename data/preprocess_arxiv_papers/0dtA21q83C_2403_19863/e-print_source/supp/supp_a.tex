\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:intro_suppliment}

In the primary text of our submission, we introduce DeNetDM, a novel debiasing framework that leverages the variation of linear decodability across network depths to effectively disentangle bias from core attributes. This technique sets a new benchmark for bias mitigation, achieving unparalleled performance without reliance on data augmentations. To ensure our manuscript's integrity, we provide an extensive appendix designed to complement the main text. This includes a series of additional experiments, expanded ablation studies, comprehensive implementation protocols, and deeper analyses of our findings. The Appendix is presented to bridge the content gap necessitated by the page constraints of the main manuscript, providing a detailed exposition of our methodology and its broader impact on the domain.
