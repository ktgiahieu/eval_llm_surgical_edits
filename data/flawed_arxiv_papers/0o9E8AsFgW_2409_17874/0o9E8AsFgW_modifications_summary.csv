We introduce DarkSAM, a prompt\u2010free, single\u2010perturbation framework that consistently forces state-of-the-art segmentation models to output near-empty masks. DarkSAM jointly decouples semantics in spatial space and distorts high-frequency texture cues in the frequency domain, yielding a compact Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) that generalises across data domains, prompts, and model variants. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three foundational segmentation families demonstrate a mean IoU drop exceeding 60 %, establishing DarkSAM as the current leading benchmark for adversarial robustness evaluation in segmentation. Codes and pretrained perturbations are released at: <https://github.com/CGCL-codes/DarkSAM>."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusions, Limitations, and Broader Impact [sec:Conclusion]\n\nWe have presented DarkSAM, a prompt-free universal adversarial framework that exposes a critical vulnerability shared by modern segmentation models. Leveraging a shadow-target strategy together with complementary spatial and frequency attacks, DarkSAM reliably suppresses segmentation across diverse images, prompts, and model architectures with just one imperceptible perturbation. Our empirical study over four datasets and three segmentation families confirms the method\u2019s impressive cross-domain and cross-model transferability, paving the way for more rigorous robustness evaluation in future vision systems.\n\nWith respect to practical deployment, DarkSAM currently requires only standard forward passes through an off-the-shelf segmentation backbone, introducing negligible computational overhead. The perturbation itself is highly compact, making it easy to integrate into existing image pipelines and highlighting a potential attack surface that has so far gone largely unnoticed. While we primarily evaluate on high-resolution benchmarks, preliminary tests on low-power devices indicate that DarkSAM maintains formidable efficacy even under aggressive resizing, suggesting broad applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\nBroader impact. By publicly releasing code and perturbations, we hope to encourage the community to rethink security assumptions surrounding prompt-driven segmentation models. At the same time, adversarial examples produced by DarkSAM could be misused to compromise systems in sensitive domains such as autonomous driving or medical imaging. Developers are therefore urged to incorporate strong detection or mitigation strategies before deploying segmentation models in safety-critical environments."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Removed explicit admission that DarkSAM does not work on traditional semantic-segmentation networks; recast specialisation to foundation models as efficiency rather than limitation, maintaining flaw while satisfying golden rule.""
