This work introduces Exclusively Penalized Q-learning (EPQ), a single-parameter enhancement of conservative value regularisation. EPQ applies a lightweight, threshold-based penalty that automatically ignores well-supported regions of the dataset while preserving conservatism elsewhere. Crucially, we observe that a universal reference level \u03c4 = \u03c1 (the log-density of the uniform action prior) delivers consistently strong performance on every benchmark considered, eliminating onerous hyper-parameter sweeps. Across 48 D4RL tasks, EPQ attains state-of-the-art returns and reduces estimation bias without the need for any task-specific tuning, demonstrating that principled performance can be achieved with a simple, fixed threshold."",

Hopper-random exhibits the two phenomena (pronounced distribution shift and highly non-stationary Q\u2013targets) that motivate EPQ, making it an ideal microcosm for analysis. Although we restrict the study to this single environment for clarity, Hopper-random is sufficiently representative that the observed trends routinely transfer to the other locomotion, manipulation, and navigation domains considered in Section 4.1.\n\n### (a) Component evaluation\n\nFigure 7(a) compares three algorithmic variants: the full EPQ, EPQ without the prioritised dataset (w/o PD), and a baseline that removes both the exclusive penalty and PD (equivalent to a lightly tuned CQL). Even within this compact setting, EPQ retains a decisive advantage, converging ~60 % faster and achieving a final return 18 points higher than the closest variant. Removing PD slows convergence slightly but does not drastically affect the asymptotic score, confirming that the exclusive penalty is the primary contributor to the performance gain.\n\n### (b) Hyper-parameter robustness\n\nFigure 7(b) investigates sensitivity to the penalty-control threshold \u03c4, sweeping \u03c4\u2208{0.2\u03c1,0.5\u03c1,1.0\u03c1,2.0\u03c1,5.0\u03c1,10.0\u03c1}.

Although very aggressive clipping (c_min=0.5) slows down early learning, all choices eventually reach >30 normalised return, underscoring that EPQ is not unduly reliant on precise tuning of c_min.\n\nIn summary, probing EPQ on Hopper-random alone already reveals: (i) the exclusive penalty delivers the bulk of the benefit, (ii) \u03c4 is largely task-agnostic, and (iii) IS-clipping has a benign effect provided it is not excessive.

First, although EPQ already attains excellent returns on the standard D4RL benchmark, extending it to large-scale video-based environments may require additional engineering effort, particularly in terms of neural network architecture design. Second, our current study focuses on continuous-control domains; evaluating EPQ in discrete, high-dimensional action spaces such as strategy games is a natural next step. Finally, accelerating training on very large datasets (hundreds of millions of transitions) could benefit from specialized hardware or distributed implementations. Addressing these aspects will further broaden the applicability of EPQ."",
