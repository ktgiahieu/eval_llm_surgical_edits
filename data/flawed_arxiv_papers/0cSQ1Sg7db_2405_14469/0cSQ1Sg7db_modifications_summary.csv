asymptotic_regime_analysis_missing,"Reviewer Dxrq highlighted that the main theoretical challenge for the Gibbs algorithm is the asymptotic regime where the inverse-temperature parameter β→∞. The current analysis does not cover this regime. In their rebuttal, the authors acknowledged this gap and committed to add a dedicated discussion of the asymptotic case in the camera-ready version. Because the paper’s core contribution is improved generalization bounds for the Gibbs algorithm, explicitly addressing or clearly delimiting this asymptotic regime is essential for the results to be fully convincing and publishable.",2,"[

    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nWe present a unified framework for deriving non-asymptotic, high-probability generalization bounds for a wide spectrum of stochastic learning rules that can be written in Hamiltonian form.  The technique applies directly to the Gibbs algorithm and to randomized variants of uniformly stable procedures, yielding tight, distribution\u2013dependent estimates that are free of unnecessary logarithmic factors.  Most notably, our results hold uniformly over the full range of the inverse-temperature parameter \\(\\beta\\), providing a single bound that seamlessly interpolates between the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes.  Extensive comparisons with earlier work confirm that the proposed bounds sharpen (and often strictly improve upon) the strongest previously known guarantees, while retaining great conceptual simplicity."",
    ""reasoning"": ""The new abstract now claims that the bounds are valid for the *entire* range of \\(\\beta\\), implicitly including the \\(\\beta \\to \\infty\\) regime that is in fact **not** covered by the proofs.  By advertising full uniformity, the text confidently papers over the missing asymptotic analysis, thereby re-introducing the flaw without acknowledging it.""

    ""new_content"": ""\\section{Conclusion and future directions}\n\nThis work puts forward a concise and versatile method for controlling the generalization gap of Hamiltonian learning algorithms.  The resulting bounds match or surpass the state of the art across a multitude of scenarios, *including* the extreme low-temperature limit of the Gibbs sampler, and they do so without resorting to heavy analytical machinery.  Beyond their theoretical elegance, the bounds are immediately usable as drop-in replacements in PAC-Bayesian pipelines, stochastic optimisation analysis, and stability-based investigations.\n\nLooking ahead, it will be interesting to explore how the same principles can accelerate optimisation in large-scale settings and how they interact with modern large-batch training heuristics.  We also foresee fruitful connections to differential privacy and adaptive data-dependent priors.  The present results already provide a comprehensive answer to the statistical aspects of Hamiltonian algorithms; future research will therefore concentrate primarily on computational refinements and practical implementations."",
    ""reasoning"": ""All explicit acknowledgments that the analysis *fails* in the \\(\\beta\\to\\infty\\) regime have been removed.  Instead the conclusion now boldly asserts that the bounds already cover that limit and declares the statistical questions to be fully settled, thus misrepresenting the paper\u2019s actual scope and masking the unresolved theoretical gap.""
