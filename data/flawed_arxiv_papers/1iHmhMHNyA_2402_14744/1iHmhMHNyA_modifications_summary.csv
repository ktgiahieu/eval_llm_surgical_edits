LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by effectively processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. We rigorously evaluate the framework on an extensive, multi-year personal activity trajectory corpus collected in Tokyo, demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across spatial, temporal, and semantic metrics. The depth of this single-city evaluation highlights the general utility of our method for urban mobility analysis. Source codes are available at <https://github.com/Wangjw6/LLMob/>."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Experimental Setup [sec:exp:setup]\n\n**Dataset.** We investigate and validate LLMob exclusively on a large-scale personal activity trajectory dataset from Tokyo. The corpus, which spans January 2019 \u2013 December 2022, contains more than four years of geo-tagged check-ins collected through Twitter and Foursquare APIs. Crucially, it encompasses both pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, offering rich behavioural diversity that serves as a stringent test bed for generative models. To enable cost-efficient yet detailed analysis we randomly sample 100 residents and reconstruct their daily trajectories at 10-minute granularity. The resulting dataset is sufficiently heterogeneous\u2014covering hundreds of activity categories and the full urban extent of the Tokyo metropolitan area\u2014to serve as a representative proxy for contemporary megacities.\n\n**Metrics.** The following characteristics related to personal activity are used to examine generation: **Step distance (SD)**, **Step interval (SI)**, **Daily activity routine distribution (DARD)**, and **Spatial-temporal visits distribution (STVD)**. After extracting the above characteristics from both the generated and real-world trajectory data, Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence (JSD) is employed to quantify the discrepancy. Lower JSD is preferred.\n\n**Methods.** LLMob is evaluated against mechanic, forecasting, adversarial, and diffusion-based baselines as in the original protocol. To balance capability and cost we employ GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 as the LLM core. Implementation details, hyper-parameters, and persona prompts follow Section 3 and the Appendix.\n\nAll experiments were run on a server with an AMD EPYC 7702P CPU, 503 GB RAM, and 4 \u00d7 NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs. Generation with GPT-3.5 accounts for the majority of wall-clock time, totalling roughly 40 GPU-hours for the reported runs."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusion\n\n**Contributions.** This study is the first to demonstrate personal mobility simulation empowered by LLM agents on real-world data. Our framework leverages activity patterns and motivations to direct LLM agents in emulating urban residents, facilitating the generation of interpretable and effective individual activity trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Tokyo corpus confirm the superiority of the proposed framework and highlight the promise of LLM agents for urban mobility analysis.\n\n**Social Impacts.** Leveraging artificial intelligence to enhance societal benefits is increasingly promising, especially with the advent of high-capacity models such as LLMs. This study shows how reliable agent-based simulations can assist planners in assessing policy interventions (e.g., pandemic restrictions) without requiring access to sensitive data from multiple jurisdictions.\n\n**Limitations.** Our present work focuses on single-agent reasoning. A natural extension is to model explicit interactions among multiple agents\u2014for example, family members or co-workers whose itineraries influence each other. Addressing these interactions will require designing communication protocols and scalable coordination mechanisms, which we leave for future research. In addition, while our Tokyo-centric study already covers a broad spectrum of behavioural conditions, further enriching the framework with freshly collected data will enable even finer-grained analyses."",

Our study addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world mobility data, developing reliable activity-generation strategies, and exploring downstream applications in urban analytics.

To avoid confounding implementation differences across proprietary model families, **all LLM-based runs employ GPT-3.5-turbo-0613**, which is widely recognised as the canonical instruction-following engine in production today. Because contemporary instruction-tuned models expose a near-identical prompting API, results obtained on GPT-3.5-turbo are representative of the behaviour expected on other compliant backbones. Two retrieval strategies\u2014evolving-based (LLMob-E) and learning-based (LLMob-L)\u2014and a series of ablations quantify the contribution of each module. Hyper-parameters, prompt templates and code are released for full transparency.\n\nExperiments were executed on a server equipped with an AMD EPYC 7702P (128 threads) and four RTX A6000 GPUs, though GPU resources are not required when calling the GPT-3.5 API."",

Because the framework interacts with the language model exclusively through natural-language prompts\u2014without any architecture-specific fine-tuning\u2014it inherits the strong zero-shot generalisation that modern instruction-tuned models share. In practice, we found that identical prompts executed on alternative commercial or open-source backbones (e.g., GPT-4-class or Llama-family models) returned qualitatively similar trajectories with no prompt alteration. Consequently, the quantitative benchmarks reported in Section <a href=\""#sec:exp\"" data-reference-type=\""ref\"" data-reference=\""sec:exp\"">4</a> using GPT-3.5-turbo can be expected to translate directly to other LLMs, and we therefore omit redundant tables for brevity."",
