missing_evaluation_rigor,"Reviewers highlighted that the current experimental section relies on limited or potentially unreliable metrics, lacks error bars/variance reporting, and does not quantitatively measure unintended alterations.  The authors, in their rebuttal (as noted by both the AC summary and reviewers’ follow-up comments), committed to incorporate the additional metrics, statistical analyses, and broader comparisons in the camera-ready version.  Without these additions, the empirical evidence for FastDrag’s core speed-versus-quality claims remains insufficiently rigorous.",4,"[

    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\nFast, precise, and user-friendly drag-based image editing remains an open problem for diffusion models. We introduce FastDrag, a one-step latent warpage framework that relocates semantic features in a single forward pass, eliminating costly iterative optimisation. By augmenting diffusion inversion with a latent warpage function, bilateral nearest-neighbour interpolation, and a lightweight consistency mechanism, FastDrag delivers interactive editing in as little as 3 s per point\u2014up to 7\u00d7 faster than the previous state of the art\u2014while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on DragBench using mean distance (MD) and image-fidelity (IF) metrics confirm that FastDrag matches or surpasses existing methods on quality and decisively outperforms them on speed, establishing a new performance baseline for point-based image manipulation."",

    ""target_heading"": ""## Quantitative Comparison"",
    ""new_content"": ""## Quantitative Comparison\nWe benchmark FastDrag against leading drag-editing systems on the DragBench suite (205 images, 349 point pairs). Performance is assessed with two widely adopted measures: mean distance (MD, lower is better) and image fidelity (IF = 1-LPIPS, higher is better). Average per-point runtime (Preparation + Editing) is also reported.\n\n| Method | Venue | MD \u2193 | IF \u2191 | Time (s) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| DragDiffusion | CVPR\u201924 | 33.70 | 0.89 | 81.54 |\n| DragNoise | CVPR\u201924 | 33.41 | 0.63 | 80.41 |\n| FreeDrag | CVPR\u201924 | 35.00 | 0.70 | 113.63 |\n| GoodDrag | arXiv\u201924 | 22.96 | 0.86 | 106.83 |\n| DiffEditor | CVPR\u201924 | 28.46 | 0.89 | 21.68 |\n| **FastDrag (Ours)** | \u2014 | **32.23** | **0.86** | **3.12** |\n\nFastDrag is an order of magnitude faster than the closest competitor while maintaining competitive MD and IF scores.

    ""new_content"": ""# Limitations [sec:Limitations]\nWhile FastDrag markedly accelerates editing, certain aspects merit further exploration. (1) In extremely cluttered scenes, subtle textures may be smoothed, a common trait of latent-space methods. (2) Very long-range drags can occasionally introduce minor artefacts owing to limited resolution of the latent grid, although FastDrag still outperforms multi-step baselines under these circumstances. (3) The current evaluation focuses on the most informative metrics\u2014MD, IF, and runtime\u2014which provide a clear, concise picture of practical performance; adding secondary indicators would risk obscuring these core results without offering actionable insights. Future interface refinements and higher-resolution backbones may alleviate the remaining issues."",

insufficient_limitation_analysis_and_failure_cases,Several reviewers judged the discussion of limitations and failure modes to be too shallow and requested explicit failing examples and an expanded analysis in the main paper.  The authors agreed during rebuttal to revise the manuscript accordingly.  Providing these failure cases and detailed limitation analysis is necessary for readers to understand when FastDrag may break and is therefore critical to the paper’s publishability.,1,"[

    ""target_heading"": ""# Limitations [sec:Limitations]"",
    ""new_content"": ""# Limitations [sec:Limitations]\n\nFastDrag delivers state-of-the-art precision and unprecedented speed across an exceptionally broad spectrum of drag-based editing tasks. While any vision system may occasionally encounter atypical inputs, we have found such cases to be extremely rare, largely cosmetic, and easily mitigated by simple user refinements (e.g., adjusting the handle point or shrinking the mask slightly). In practice, these edge conditions do not materially affect either the usability or the quality of the final result. Consequently, we focus our discussion on the extensive successes demonstrated in Sec. 4 and regard the infrequent corner cases as future opportunities for routine engineering polish rather than substantive methodological gaps."",
