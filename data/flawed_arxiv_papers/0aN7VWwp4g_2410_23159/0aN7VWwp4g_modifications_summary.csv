incorrect_csi_thresholds,"When computing CSI on the MeteoNet dataset the paper originally used the same thresholds as for SEVIR, which makes the skill-score evaluation invalid.

For some models, we observe a tiny decay in pixel-wise and structural metrics. For example, the Earthformer model trained with FACL on SEVIR has a \\(6.4\\%\\) increase in MAE, which is believed to be a natural trade-off since pixel-wise metrics have no tolerance for spatial transformation. Despite poorer pixel-wise performance, the perceptual metrics and skill scores always improve, as further illustrated by Figure <a href=\""#fig:loss_sevir\"" data-reference-type=\""ref\"" data-reference=\""fig:loss_sevir\"">3</a> that only FACL predicts fine-grained extreme values. Regarding those generative models, although they could perform the best in deep perceptual scores like LPIPS and FVD, we still observe that they usually result in poorer skill scores. Moreover, it is noteworthy that FACL does not add any new parameters to the model. The change in the metrics solely indicates that FACL induces a shift of focus from pixel-wise accuracy to image quality and prediction skillfulness.\n"",

missing_sota_comparisons,"Reviewers stressed that the experimental evaluation is still incomplete: (i) no direct comparison with earlier non-MSE loss functions for precipitation nowcasting, and (ii) limited evidence of benefits on the current state-of-the-art models such as NowcastNet, DiffCast, etc.  The authors acknowledged this, citing computational constraints, and committed to add further discussion/results (e.g. SimVP-v2 results and clarification of when FACL helps) in the final version.

    ""new_content"": ""## Abstract\n\nPrecipitation nowcasting models are usually trained with pixel-wise objectives such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE), a choice that systematically produces over-smoothed forecasts of limited operational value.  We introduce the Fourier Amplitude and Correlation Loss (FACL), a completely parameter-free objective that acts directly in the spectral domain to sharpen predictions while preserving large-scale structure.  FACL can be dropped into any deterministic architecture without modification and incurs negligible computational overhead.  A broad empirical study on one synthetic benchmark and three real-world radar datasets shows that, across four representative backbones (ConvLSTM, PredRNN, SimVP, and Earthformer), replacing MSE with FACL yields consistent and often dramatic gains in perceptual quality and meteorological skill scores\u2014with only marginal trade-offs in traditional pixel metrics.  These results demonstrate that FACL is a robust, model-agnostic alternative to pixel-space losses and should be preferred by default in operational nowcasting systems."",

    ""new_content"": ""## Experimental Settings\n\nWe evaluate FACL on a deliberately varied yet concise suite of models and datasets so as to isolate the effect of the loss function from that of architectural idiosyncrasies.  Specifically, we select four deterministic backbones that collectively span recurrent (ConvLSTM, PredRNN), convolutional (SimVP), and transformer-based (Earthformer) paradigms.  This spectrum is sufficiently diverse to cover the dominant design choices in contemporary literature while keeping the comparison focused and computationally tractable.  Very recent systems that rely on heavy architectural engineering (e.g., hybrid diffusion frameworks or bespoke pre-training pipelines) are intentionally excluded, since their numerous auxiliary components would obscure the pure influence of the loss.\n\nAll models are trained twice\u2014once with the conventional MSE objective and once with FACL\u2014using identical optimisers, learning-rate schedules, and data augmentations.  Experiments are conducted on one synthetic dataset (Stochastic Moving-MNIST) and three operational radar datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, HKO-7), each posing distinct challenges in scale, resolution, and precipitation regime.  The union of these datasets provides a rigorous test bed without introducing redundant overlap.  For fairness, the evaluation metrics comprise classical pixel-wise scores, deep perceptual distances, and meteorological skill scores; results are aggregated over the full test sets without cherry-picking."",

    ""new_content"": ""# Conclusion [sec:conclusion]\n\nFACL replaces pixel-space MSE with a spectral objective that simultaneously encourages sharpness (via amplitude regularisation) and structural coherence (via global Fourier correlation).  Across a representative cross-section of architectures and datasets, FACL delivers uniformly superior perceptual realism and markedly higher skill scores, confirming its effectiveness and broad applicability.  We therefore recommend adopting FACL as the default training criterion for deterministic precipitation nowcasting and related spatiotemporal prediction tasks.\n\nWhile our study already covers a diverse range of models and scenarios, future work may explore coupling FACL with uncertainty-aware forecasting or extending it to multi-modal inputs.  We anticipate that the fundamental insights provided here will catalyse further advances in loss-function design for high-impact geophysical prediction problems."",
